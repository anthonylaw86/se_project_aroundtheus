**Intro**

This project started out being simple and has grown into a mastery of interlaced coding. 
It features a place for user's to create a profile, update their individual avatar & share/like each other's photos.

There is different modals being used for each adjustment that you want to make as well as a hover overlay on the avatar image.

Within the coding everything has been destructured so making any adjustments to the project would be simple & should take little 
or no time at all.

I thoroughly enjoyed this project as it has broaden my knowledge of HTML, CSS & many complex syntax within JavaScript.
Can't wait to create more.
